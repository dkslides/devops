# Cultural Change

#### Agile
### Microservices
# DevOps
#### Design Thinking 
##### Cross Functional Teams
# CI/CD
### Quick Feedback Loops

# All that's the easy part

## Cross Functional Teams are awesome
### But cross functional means more than front end, back end and ops working together

---

> Cross Functional Means
##### Security
# UX
### Business

### *Everything, all the way from your user to your bank account*

And Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, and Support should be up in there to

---

## Teams need to be autonomous
### They need to be able to decide what to do, and have the authority do it

# What stands in the way is not technical

## The
# Problem

#### Management:
### Don't Give Instructions
# Give Intent

---

## Move Authority Down To Information

---

#### A cross functional team must include
# empowered leaders
> Otherwise, all the Dev, and all the Ops, and all the UX and the  Microservices, and all the fancy boards and the sticky&nbsp;note parties will get you nowhere

Thank You
